## Introduction
This projects built **General Linear Regression** model and **Random Forest** to predict poverty rate in New York City. The studies of poverty is important because it can help decision makers better understand this ongoing problem to break the cycles of poverty and prioritize effective interventions for the most at-risk groups. Our findings show that **Income, Unit Population, Family Type, Housing Type and Borough** have the strongest predictive power for poverty status. (Shown as Figure 1)
